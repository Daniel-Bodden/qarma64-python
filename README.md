# qarma64-python
Python implementation of the tweakable block cipher qarma.

Code is adjusted to the latests publication of the cipher: [current publication of Qarma](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/444.pdf).
In an earlier version of the publication had a slightly different implementation: [earlier publication of Qarma](https://eprint.iacr.org/eprint-bin/getfile.pl?entry=2016/444&version=20160506:075619&file=444.pdf) 

The main difference is a different diffiusion matrix. 

The code in this git is forked with permission from: [dkales git qarma]](https://github.com/dkales/qarma64-python).
